### Why I create this blog?

I always want to start writing to record the happiness and sadness in my life, but all I did was build a VPS/blog/WordPress and now pelican and then - totally forget about it after the website is up. This time, instead of building the website first, I am going to start writing first, then gradually improve the website.

After wasting all my nights in the last past seven months in endless web browsing, I am going to do something that memorable. 

Writing is also a good way to improve my English. As a Chinese moved to Ireland since 2008, I spent my first 5 years in the Chinese circle, no wonder my English has not improved.
