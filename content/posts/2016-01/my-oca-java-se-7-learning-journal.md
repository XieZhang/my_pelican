Summary:
Status: 

Since 2012, I started considering to take the OCA Java exam(It was Java 6 at that time). After three years, I am still in the nowhere. In December 2015, I finished reading Oracle's OCA/OCP Java SE 7 Programmer I & II Study Guide Part I and took the mock exam myself. I got 58% in score three times in a row and then, I decided not to take the exam until I can get 75% at least.

Now, nearly two months later, I am still where I am in December last year. I guess if I keep reading the book and practise with the sample questions, I might already get the certificate by now. What was I doing in my last two months? Ehmm... I can't remember.

Ok, let's make it serious. From today - 15th January 2016, I will start reviewing it again. This time, I will keep writing some learning journal while I am reading the book and answering the sample question.

I am using Google Doc for notes taking.

Let's see what I can get!
