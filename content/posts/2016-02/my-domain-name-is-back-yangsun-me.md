Summary:
Status: draft

I bought tons of domain in the last few years - qero.net, ebe.me, yang.so and the one I fiinally started using since yesterday afternoon - YangSun.me

This domain was registered on an impluse in late 2014, but due to the work load from the study of my master course in UCD, it took me more than a year to get my hand on this domain.

Yesterday afternoon, I was reading a Java Cert book and started feeling boring with the tricky exam questions, so I did a quick lookup on my favourate domain reseller - [NameCheap](#)

Why it is my favourate?
Github student pack!
free one year .me domain register

This history of this domain and me

Why i decide to use this domain?


what about other domain names?
