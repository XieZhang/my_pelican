I bought tons of domain in the last few years - qero.net, ebe.me, yang.so and the one I finally started using since yesterday afternoon - YangSun.me

This domain was registered on an impulse in late 2014, but due to the workload from the study of my master course in UCD, it took me more than a year to get my hand on this domain.

Yesterday afternoon, I was reading a Java Cert book and started feeling boring with the tricky exam questions, so I did a quick lookup on my favourite domain reseller - [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/?aff=96185). Yes! My expired domain can be registered now. I registered the domain and added three DNS settings, less than 12 hours, YangSun.me is up and running.

The first time I notice [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/?aff=96185) is from GitHub. GitHub has a special perk for students called [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). The pack has many free bits for students(like free one year .me domain name from [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/?aff=96185), free 50$ credit in [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/f68d634be5d8), and many more!)

This domain was first registered in December 2014 when I was attending my Master course in [UCD](http://www.ucd.ie). The main reason at that time was I want to create a website with my CV and my project on it. After I registered the domain for free with [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/?aff=96185), I created an HTML page and link it to [my GitHub](http://github.com/s27y). Then I totally forgot about the website for a whole year.

### What am I going do with this domain? ###

I always want to start writing to record the happiness, sadness and the random things happened in my life, but all I did was build a VPS/blog/WordPress and now pelican and then - totally forget about it after the website is up. This time, instead of building the website first, I am going to start writing first, then gradually improve the website.

### What about other domain names? ###

#### ebe.me ####

This domain was first registered five years ago when I was attending my undergraduate course in [DKIT](www.dkit.ie). Along with this domain, I also brought three years shared hosting plan from [GoDaddy](www.goDadday.com). At 2011, there was not much choice I can use to build a blog on a shared hosting plan, so I set up a WordPress on it, and I did wrote few blogs there in Chinese. Not long, it was abandoned.

#### yang.so ####

This is my first attempt to create a personal brand - So Yang(So Young). I tried to write some Linux tips and hints on it, but then i gave up.
I am gooing to keep this domain if I have extra money to waste (.so domain cost $59 year, it isn't a small amount for a personal domain). Hopefully, I can keep it for my side projects.
